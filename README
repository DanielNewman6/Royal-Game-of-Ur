The Royal Game of Ur is a board game from ancient Babylon, reconstructed by archaeologists. The object of the game is to move all of your pieces around the board and off
the other end before your opponent gets all theirs round. In the central line of spaces, pieces moved onto a non-rosette space occupied by an opponent's piece move it
off the board and back to their starting pile.
